# pkgmap

Script and look up tables to help map package names between linux distros.

Note that https://repology.org/ is a major resource for handling this problem.

## Naming Things

Arguably the only important skill in software engineering is to name things well.

"Notation is powerful, invent it.", Richard Feynman.

After all, it's all language. In that context, the reason it took me a while to find
repology was that I started with the misconception that this problem is to do with
the package managers.  I like their perspective that what the package managers do
is to create a layer of new names over the original projects which abstracts the
essence of what the distribution seeks (the interface) from the implementation
(a given open source repository).   This is a good idea.  The fact that different
distributions choose different names is inevitable in the absence of standardisation.
No doubt in due course a standardisation may emerge.
